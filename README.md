# Project Background & Methods
Revisiting the Kaggle competition: Quora insincere Question Classification to combine Natural Language Processing Techniques and Machine Learning Algorithms to predict a question's sincerity. 

Quora is a user based website that grants every day individuals a forum to ask questions and share their relevant experiences and knowledge. As of 2023, Quora has over 300 million users who ask an average of 4000 questions per day. With such volume, inevitably, some posts have an inflammatory and hostile nature that negatively affect other userâ€™s experience. We hope to address this issue with an accurate and adaptable model to identify such insincere posts. 

In this project, we perform data exploration and various data normalization tasks to ensure that we begin with good-quality data. Next, we utilize NLP techniques and insights for further processing. After processing, we begin feature extraction using the traditional and advanced models. Finally, we train and evaluate a variety of classifiers. Throughout the project, we face many technical changes which serve as a great base for learning and problem-solving.
